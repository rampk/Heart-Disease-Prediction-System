# Heart Disease Prediction System
Understanding why and when patients are most likely to get heart disease can be helpful in early detection and diagnosis. I will be using a step-by-step systematic approach using a method that could be used for a variety of ML problems. <br>

Given that we have data of former patients, this is a standard **supervised classification problem** where the label is a binary variable, 0 (not suffering from heart disease), 1 (suffering from heart disease). In this study, our target variable Y is the probability of a patient having heart disease. <br>

In this case study, the dataset was sourced from [Kaggle Cardiovascular disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) which contains data for 70,000 patients with various information about their health and lifestyle.
